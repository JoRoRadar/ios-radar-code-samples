     The xCode simulator has few options for simulating location. Using a GPX file we can simulate
    a basic location update.
    
    For the 'Arrival Push Notification' feature we need to simulate traveling to a geofence. Below
    are three 'waypoints' that xCode can simulate travel between. Here are the explanation between
    the three waypoints:
    1) The first waypoint can be any location outside of your destination (Radar Geofence)
    2) This should be a point within the Radar Geofence you are setting as your destination
    3) This should be a point within the Radar Geofence that isn't the same is waypoint #2. ***
    
    ** This third waypoint effectively prevents xCode from looping over waypoints and allows the simulator to idle
    at this location. This helps with sync'ing up simulated locations with Radar's tracking cadence.**
    
    Note: The timestamps indicate that the travel between each point will take 10 seconds then "pause" for 1 day.
